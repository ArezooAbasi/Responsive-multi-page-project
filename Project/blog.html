                <h2>Our Certificates </h2>
                <p>In many countries, students are required to pay tuition fees.
                   Many students look to get 'student grants' to cover the cost of university.
                   In 2016, the average outstanding student loan balance per borrower in the United
                   States was US$30,000. In many U.S. states, costs are anticipated to rise for students
                   as a result of decreased state funding given to public universities. Many universities
                   in the United States offer students the opportunity to apply for financial scholarships
                   to help pay for tuition based on academic achievement.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are several major exceptions on tuition fees. In many European countries,
                   it is possible to study without tuition fees. Public universities in Nordic countries were entirely
                   without tuition fees until around 2005. Denmark, Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition
                   fees for foreign students. Citizens of EU and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain
                   exempted from tuition fees, and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students
                   were increased to offset some of the impact. The situation in Germany is similar; public universities
                   usually do not charge tuition fees apart from a small administrative fee. For degrees of a postgraduate
                   professional level sometimes tuition fees are levied. Private universities, however, almost always charge
                   tuition fees.</p>
                   <br>
                  <p>The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world.
                    In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from
                    donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of
                    students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all
                    over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental.
                    An example is the Academy of European Law, which offers training in European law to lawyers, judges,
                    barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. EUCLID (PÃ´le Universitaire Euclide, Euclid University)
                    is chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries,
                    and the United Nations University engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to
                    the United Nations, its peoples and member states. The European University Institute, a post-graduate university
                    specialized in the social sciences, is officially an intergovernmental organization, set up by the member
                    states of the European Union.</p>
